# My cheatsheets

The cheatsheets presented here are only intended for my own use. If they help you, feel free to use them but keep in mind that they are probably incomplete and incorrect.

Having said that, you might want to use them as a template for creating your own cheatsheets. The css and js make it very easy to create decent looking ones.

Use syntax highlighting like this:
	<code data-language="python">print "Hello World"</code>
or set the default language like this:
	<body data-language="python">
		<code>print "Hello World"</code>
	</body>

Use the following classes for different sized articles:

*  <article class="small">
*  <article>
*  <article class="large">
*  <article class="full">

Supported:

*  Javascript
*  HTML
*  CSS
*  Python
*  Ruby
*  Shell
*  Java
*  PHP
*  Coffeescript
*  C
*  Go
*  Scheme
*  Lua
